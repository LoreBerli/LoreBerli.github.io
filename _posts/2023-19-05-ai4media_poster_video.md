## AI4Media
The 7th AI4Media Plenary Meeting was held at the University of Florence between January 31st and February 1st 2023. During the event, the technical partners of Work Packages 3, 4, 5, and 6 presented their work through posters and demos and demonstrated live the use case demonstrators. A debate space was also provided for the partners to exchange ideas and get to know each other's work. [ai4media](https://www.ai4media.eu/)

This is my presentation of a work-in-progress paper focused on analog video restoration.
